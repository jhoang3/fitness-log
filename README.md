My first attempt at building a website. 

For those new to launching a local website (since I don't have the money to host this website anywhere else), this README file will help with that.
1. First, take the code files and load them into a remote file.
2. Next, read the fies into a code editor. I recommend Visual Studio Code since it's a mainstream and simple editor, though it's arguable slow.
3. Once open, run "python manage.py runserver" and open the link provided.
